  abstract = {This research examines Twitter discourse related to \#BlackLivesMatter and police-related shooting events in 2016 through a mixed-method, interpretative approach. We construct a "shared audience graph", revealing structural and ideological disparities between two groups of participants (one on the political left, the other on the political right). We utilize an integrated networked gatekeeping and framing lens to examine how \#BlackLivesMatter frames were produced--and how they were contested--by separate communities of supporters and critics. Among other empirical findings, this work demonstrates hashtags being used in diverse ways--e.g. to mark participation, assert individual identity, promote group identity, and support or challenge a frame. Considered from a networked gatekeeping perspective, we illustrate how hashtags can serve as channeling mechanisms, shaping trajectories of information flow. This analysis also reveals a right-leaning community of BlackLivesMatter critics to have a more well-defined group of crowdsourced elite who largely define their side's counter-frame.},

  abstract = {Prior work on transgender technology users in CSCW has primarily focused on how they interact with algorithms and communication technology, empirically identifying specific use cases and profiles, and speaking largely to the designers and developers of these platforms. This work has emphasized how trans people are excluded, harmed, and misrepresented in existing platforms, algorithms, and research methods. While these critiques are important, this paper explores what trans-inclusive quantitative methods could be by applying a participant- or user-driven approach. While the problem of trans-inclusive, -affirming, or -empowering research methods is not specifically a CSCW problem---as we directly confront by comparing and contrasting the perspectives of CSCW and conventional demography---we argue that a CSCW lens may be uniquely suited to addressing it. To this end, this paper makes several contributions: conceptually, we identify points of increasing convergence between conventional demographic research methods (and criticisms thereof) and CSCW, focusing on shared limitations surrounding how identity is handled in research; methodologically, we present a sketch of how these limitations might be addressed by using social network analysis to "triangulate" social identities while considering them relative and situated; empirically, we implement these methods in a case study of gender within the broader social context of Reddit and discuss the results.},

  abstract = {Previous work on classifying Twitter users’ political alignment has mainly focused on lexical and social network features. This study provides evidence that political affiliation is also reflected in features which have been previously overlooked: users’ discourse patterns (proportion of Tweets that are retweets or replies) and their rate of use of capitalization and punctuation. We find robust differences between politically left- and right-leaning communities with respect to these discourse and sub-lexical features, although they are not enough to train a high-accuracy classifier.}
