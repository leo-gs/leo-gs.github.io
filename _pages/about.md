Hello! My name is <b>Leo</b>. I am a <b>data scientist</b> and PhD candidate in Seattle Washington. This is my portfolio website. I think of myself as an expert in <b>data communication</b>, drawing on a background in computer science and user-centered design. I care about finding the human element in computation, whether through <b>data visualization</b>, <b>designing infrastructure for data workflows</b>, or <b>developing software</b>.
